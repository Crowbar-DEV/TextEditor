Buffer Handling
===============================================================
Instead of storing the file buffer into a char vector
we can just store it as the actual filebuf object. That
way we can make use of the filebuf methods which make 
manipulation very easy.

We can also replace the standard output with this filebuf, making
sure to save standard output before replacement, then we can
update the replaced stdout every loop, and it should just write
to the terminal, as the terminal just displays stdout.

at start of program, we open file, we must make sure to close it
upon termination.
